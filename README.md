ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are: He/Him or They/Them (I don't care)

ðŸ”­ Stuff i'm working on right now are
- My [website](https://www.euphonit.uk), and the code can also be seen at my [web](https://github.com/Euphonit/web) repository

ðŸ™Ž Some of my opinions are:
- My favorite programming launguage is Javascript
- There should be a better alternative to git
- React won
- Typescript is over-hyped
- Javascript is not actually that bad, it's just a still evolving and growing langauge that is being used for stuff it was never intended to be used for
