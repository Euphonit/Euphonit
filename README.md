ðŸ™Ž Some of my opinions are:
- My favorite programming launguage is Javascript
- There should be a better alternative to git
- Typescript is over-hyped
- Javascript is not actually that bad, it's just a still evolving and growing langauge that is being used for stuff it was never intended to be used for
